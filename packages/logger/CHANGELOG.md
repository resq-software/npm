## 0.3.0
### Minor Changes



- [#171](https://github.com/resq-software/npm/pull/171) [`1f28d41`](https://github.com/resq-software/npm/commit/1f28d4141dbaf389f0096cb93fde02e2a553e3ca) Thanks [@WomB0ComB0](https://github.com/WomB0ComB0)! - Implement the LogTransport Observer pipeline: Logger.addTransport/removeTransport/clearTransports fan every log out as a structured LogEntry with full error isolation, plus built-in MemoryTransport, JsonTransport, and composable createFilterTransport/byLevel



- [#171](https://github.com/resq-software/npm/pull/171) [`1f28d41`](https://github.com/resq-software/npm/commit/1f28d4141dbaf389f0096cb93fde02e2a553e3ca) Thanks [@WomB0ComB0](https://github.com/WomB0ComB0)! - Add SimpleLogLevel to exclude "error" from data-logging decorator levels, dedupe LogData/LoggerOptions/ColorKey to a single canonical source, and add exhaustive level-name parsing

## 0.2.0
### Minor Changes



- [#167](https://github.com/resq-software/npm/pull/167) [`c80c8b8`](https://github.com/resq-software/npm/commit/c80c8b8f0eecd3e12af3e74cdd26aac98337675b) Thanks [@WomB0ComB0](https://github.com/WomB0ComB0)! - Rebrand to ResQ Systems: rename npm scope `@resq-sw/*` → `@resq-systems/*`

  **BREAKING (npm scope rename):** every package is republished under the new
  `@resq-systems` scope. Consumers must update imports and dependencies from
  `@resq-sw/<pkg>` to `@resq-systems/<pkg>`; the old `@resq-sw/*` packages will be
  deprecated on npm. Also updates the short brand name to "ResQ Systems", email
  copy and From-name to "ResQ Systems", and standardizes copyright/author metadata
  to "ResQ Systems, Inc." Domains (`resq.software`) and the product name
  ("ResQ Tactical OS") are unchanged.
